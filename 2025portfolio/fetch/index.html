                    <h3>A single platform was needed to unite three distinct food delivery brands</h3>
                    <p>After a three company merger, our clients needed to build a new platform to address the needs of all of their users. They had three different brands, brand loyalty, and wanted to retain each brand and improve their UX, without the technical burden of maintaining separate platforms for each. They partnered with Crema to design and architect this new foundation. <b>The goal was one clean and competitively featured food delivery app UX for all three brands that could visually adapt and even prepare for a fourth unknown brand in the future.</b></p>
                    <p>I partnered closely with another Product Designer on this project. We were each allocated at 50% of our time. Our broader team included a Product Manager, Test Engineer, and the development team who would bring our designs to life.</p>

                <h2 class="small-caps">Discovery & Approach</h2>
                <h3>Plugin experimentation led to a token-based theming solution for the UI with JSON exports</h3>

                <p>In 2021, native Figma features for theme management like variables and modes did not exist. We needed a robust way to manage distinct visual styles and deliver intuitive core flows, all within a single Figma library ensure developers could replicate this efficiently.</p>

                <p>The foundation and alignment with eng would be key to meeting all our goals for the 6-month deadline, so we spent several weeks focusing on finding the best approach in collab with our front-end peers. After research and experimentation, we settled on using the <b>Atlas Theme Switcher plugin</b> to manage the visual brand swaps directly within our Figma library ‚Äì colors, type styles, and logos. </p>

                <p><b>We architected the entire system and design file around design tokens</b>, meticulously defining base values for each brand and also for everything else, from spacing units to shadows. But Atlas didn't come with development integration, so after I explored a number of options, we used the <b>Design Tokens plugin to export our tokens as a JSON file</b>. Our dev team were able to implement a parallel theme-switching mechanism in the codebase for the components powering our designed user flows, mirroring our Figma setup.</p>

                <h2 class="small-caps">Design Approach</h2>
                <h3>We designed the core food delivery experience while co-creating the design system</h3>
                <p>My design partner and I worked in lockstep, tackling both the user experience and the system architecture. We designed all key screens and flows necessary for a food delivery service, including <b>restaurant discovery and search, menu browsing, order customization, account creation and management, checkout, and order tracking</b>. We focused on creating an intuitive and clear path for users through each stage, prototyping and refining these core interactions using our placeholder "Fetch" brand as the neutral base.</p>

                <p>This foundational UX work happened in parallel with building the design system, but once the design system groundwork was done, our UI work was much easier. Our collaboration was fluid, allowing us to critique flows, brainstorm UI solutions, and build components together. By the project's end, our individual contributions had totally blended, resulting in a stronger, unified product experience we were both proud of and couldn't even recall who had designed which pieces. </p>

                    <h3>We delivered a scalable multi-brand platform foundation and core user experience</h3>
                    <p>The collaboration on this project made us really successful. We were able to meet what felt like an ambitious deadline, even a bit ahead of schedule. And after all our work breaking down themeing, and later documenting every state for each component, the final product looked exactly like our designs. I had a lot of fun exploring this space. Our eventual solution would have been so much easier with today's Figma features, but it was exciting to work on something that requires creative problem solving.</p>

                <p>This project was a rewarding experience in designing a complete product experience while simultaneously overcoming technical constraints through creative problem-solving and teamwork. It highlighted how powerful close partnership between designers, and between design and development, can be in building complex, high-quality digital products.</p>

                        It's obvious that your Waitr work is phenomenal, but just to provide a personal comparison... I worked for a company that had a whole team of like 10 people working on its design system... The level of organization and the ease of handoff... that you have put in to Waitr **knocks that system out of the park.**
