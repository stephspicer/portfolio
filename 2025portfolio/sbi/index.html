                <h2 class="small-caps">Context</h2>    
                <h3>SBI offers revenue consulting services, and SBI Pro is digital platform for their clients</h3>

                <p>Prior to starting this platform, I led the redesign of SBI's marketing website for a 4-month project, including web content and branding work. After that, we continued to partner with the client to build SBI Pro, their data and content based platform to add value to their consulting services. This case study focuses on SBI Pro, which after launch <b>empowered clients to visualize their business performance, benchmark KPIs against industry standards, and track their progress towards revenue goals, and allowed SBI to expand their business with this platform as a subscription service</b>.</p>

                <h2 class="small-caps">Constraints</h2>    
                <h3>A unique design process: I couldn't interact with CEO users and there was no established brand</h3>
                <p>Because SBI's clients are C-level execs, access to actual users or even those of a similar demographic for research was a challenge. I worked closely with the client CTO and the sales team, to provide mockups to show to clients and provided guidance on presenting designs for feedback in a non-leading way. </p>
                <p>There was no visual design guidance for SBI, so while we'd done some branding work in our 4-month engagement, the brand continued to evolve as we built the product to grow as SBI was. Practically speaking, this meant I worked with color and typography a lot more than usual as a product designer, which was really fun! </p>

                <h3>Our initial release features focused on content, organizing consulting documents, and the maturity assessment</h3>
                <p>We needed to design and develop fast, so the MVP work was honestly rapid collaboration and UI production. After that we were able to deep dive. But it's worth starting at the bigger picture of what this platform entailed.</p>

            <h3>A big part of how SBI consultants help execs is showing them which KPIs to focus on. How do we help visualize that?</h3>

            <p>The consulting relationship centers meetings, manual data collection about the client business, and consultants custom making a lot of slide decks with a lot of charts to share with execs. And then making updated decks throughout the engagement after KPIs change.. etc. So we wanted to explore how to bring that data into the platform in a dynamic way. </p>

                <h4>Ideating on the key chart: your growth metric vs the SBI benchmark range</h4>

                <p>Just from the ideas of the core team, we tried a lot of initial iteration for the key chart. The basic concept is that <b>we want to show the client‚Äôs KPI, along with a comparison of the ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù which is an anonymized range collected from other clients, the secret sauce</b> if you will. </p>
                <p > We didn‚Äôt love any of them and clients were confused. And we wanted to further explore brand colors. </p>

                <p>Where the SBI Growth Index range is good, Best is Class is who you should compare to, and your latest data is shown relative to each -- incentivizing growth and continued updates within SBI Pro. Additionally, the definition is provided. Each growth metric has a detail page, showing a further breakdown, the actual box and whiskers distribution data, and the metric‚Äôs change over time for both users and the SBI range.</p>

                <p>I designed a data entry onboarding flow, data management screens for both clients and advisors, a page to house consultant suggested initiatives and goals which integrates with the KPI and benchmark data, and locked states urging clients to share more of their KPIs.</p>

                <h3>SBI Pro has grown to a successful subscription add-on for consultants</h3>
                <p>While I don‚Äôt have specific metrics since it was a client engagement and new product, SBI Pro has become a key offering for SBI‚Äôs business, and the first subscription based service of its kind -- adding value and efficiency for clients by leveraging their proprietary data and insights without sharing confidential info.</p>

                <p>The revenue consulting space was unfamiliar and may seem dry, but this is one of my favorite projects I‚Äôve done! The team was amazing, the charts were super interesting, and making something with such an open design system and brand was a unique experience.</p>
